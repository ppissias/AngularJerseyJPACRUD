# AngularJerseyJPACRUD
 This is a basic example of an Angular frontend application with a Java backend REST API.
 This is a simple "CRUD" (Create Read Update Delete) example with very simple date. 
 The Java backend is implemented with Jersey (REST provider) and JPA (using Derby as the underlying database)
